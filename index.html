          <img src="images/born.png" alt="born" style="vertical-align:middle">
          <p>I was born in South Korea. My grandparents, parents, older sister and younger brother lived together. My
            grandparents are so lovely and kind. They were always good to me. I have beautiful memories with
            them.</p>

          <h1>1981</h1>
          <img src="images/boy.png" alt="born" style="vertical-align:middle">
          <p>I entered an elementary school. I was so happy to be in school. And then I went to a middle school in my
            home town. And then I moved to a near city for a high school.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="1990">
          <h1>1990</h1>
          <img src="images/pray.png" alt="born" style="vertical-align:middle">
          <p>I entered a mission school. And I met Jesus. Jesus has changed my whole life. I realized who I am. Jesus
            taught me how to live. I was also devoted to church activities.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="1993">
          <h1>1993</h1>
          <img src="images/job.png" alt="born" style="vertical-align:middle">
          <p>I entered university. However, I had to get a job for my tuition. It was not easy for me. The real world
            came to me. It was hard but sometimes fun. And I could find some possibilities for my future.</p>
        </li>
  
        <li id="2000">
          <h1>2000</h1>
          <img src="images/graduation.png" alt="born" style="vertical-align:middle">
          <p>Finally, I graduated university. Every healthy young Korean man should do military service. Meanwhile I did
            it and I got a bachelor degree.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="2003">
          <h1>2003</h1>
          <img src="images/dating.png" alt="born" style="vertical-align:middle">
          <p>I met a beautiful woman. She was a pianist. She visited a church and played piano. I had crush on her at
            first. I kept contacting her and had dates.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="2005">
          <h1>2005</h1>
          <img src="images/wedding.png" alt="born" style="vertical-align:middle">
          <p>I proposed to the pianist. She accepted it. Finally, I got married with most beautiful woman in the world.
            And I realized that ‘to live happily ever after’ is not true. Another world came to me.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="2015">
          <h1>2015</h1>
          <img src="images/family.png" alt="born" style="vertical-align:middle">
          <p>I would tell that it’s only God’s grace. Frankly speaking, my wife and I haven’t had a plan for children.
            But God gave us children. Finally, my family was set. We have 3 sons and a daughter. And I was shocked that
            the last baby was a princess. Her brothers are monsters, but she is a princess. I don’t understand what
            happened. Maybe her mom must be a queen.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="2019">
          <h1>2019</h1>
          <img src="images/canada.png" alt="born" style="vertical-align:middle">
          <p>My family moved to Canada. Like Abraham, my wife and I have departed without knowing where to go. All
            process took time but it was fine. It was hard for my family to say good bye to people including parents,
            friends and so on.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="2020">

          <img src="images/programmer.png" alt="born" style="vertical-align:middle">
          <p>I got some jobs in Canada, but I was not satisfied with them. God led me to study. Then I started to study
            computer programming for the second half of my life.</p>
